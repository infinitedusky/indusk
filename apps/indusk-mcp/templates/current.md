# Operational State

This file represents the operational state for the project — what's happening RIGHT NOW. The architectural layer ("what this project is") lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). The historical layer ("how we got here") lives in `.indusk/planning/` plans + the docs site.

Two regions:

- **`## Project (shared)`** — cross-cutting state any agent can edit. Pre-launch crunch mode, merge freezes, telemetry endpoint changes, anything project-wide.
- **`## Session <short> — <task>`** blocks — per-agent operational state. Each block holds the agent's `### In Flight`, `### Open Questions`, `### Cursor`. Written via `mcp__indusk__update_current_section` at `/handoff` (or any moment something solidifies). Other agents' sections are byte-untouched by your writes.

`/catchup` reads this file pure-read. `/retrospective` distills sections of it into CLAUDE.md on plan close.

## Project (shared)

_Any agent can edit this section. Cross-cutting state that's true for the whole project right now._
